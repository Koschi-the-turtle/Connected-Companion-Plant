# Connected-Companion-Plant
idk what I'm supposed to write here as you'll need some irl components to do this yourself
but the whole code is in the main.ino file, you'll need a photoresistor and a moisture
sensor as well as an LCD screen and a speaker. And you'll probably need to tweek the 
pins to pass with your own electronic setup, and maybe tweak the threshold in case
your sensors sensibility differs from mines. Happy new year though !
